# Glossary of Persephone Raskova Thought

@Claude I want you to insert a Warning admonition here emphasizing to the reader that these are my personal definitions of ideological terms

:sorted:

Democratic Centralism
    Organizational principle combining democratic decision-making with
    centralized implementation.

Industrial Proletariat
	The industrial proletariat are those workers employed in the manufacturing of goods to be used either as inputs in a secondary process or for final consumption. It does not include the first phase of production (extraction of raw materials), nor the final stage of production (service to the end consumer). It is also distinguished from non-industrial manufacturing in its *heavy reliance on machinery as a force multiplier of labor power, the logistical infrastructure for provision of material inputs, and a constant expenditure of energy*.

dialectical materialism
    Philosophical framework combining dialectics with materialism;
    analyzes change through contradiction in material conditions.

Entryism
    Tactic of joining existing organizations to influence them from within.

historical materialism
    Application of dialectical materialism to social and historical development.

Labor Aristocracy
    This is the very best-paid and privileged stratum of the proletariat, which has arisen mostly within imperialist countries in the last century and a half. These are most often skilled workers, whose special training gives them greater bargaining power with the capitalists with regard to wages and benefits, especially where they are organized into strong craft unions. In the richest imperialist countries, such as the U.S., some workers in the labor aristocracy may even acquire some significant investments, such as rental property, stocks and bonds, though the dominant part of their income is still from wages. However, it is still only possible for this labor aristocracy to be as large as it is, and to receive as high wages and benefits as it does along with acquiring some savings and investments in some cases, because of the exploitation of large parts of the world by the imperialist ruling class. That international exploitation leads to constant imperialist wars, and ***it is necessary for the ruling class to pacify at least a major section of its workers at home with some small part of the wealth it rips off from foreign countries.*** 

Activist Subculture
	

material conditions
    Concrete economic and social circumstances that shape human existence.

OPSEC
    Operations Security; practices to protect sensitive information.

Principal Aspect of a Contradiction
	In any contradiction the development of the contradictory aspects is uneven. Sometimes they seem to be in equilibrium, which is however only temporary and relative, while unevenness is basic. Of the two contradictory aspects, one must be principal and the other secondary. *The principal aspect is the one playing the leading role in the contradiction. The nature of a thing is determined mainly by the principal aspect of a contradiction, the aspect which has gained the dominant position.* 

Principal Contradiction
	If in any process there are a number of contradictions, *one of them must be the principal contradiction playing the leading and decisive role, while the rest occupy a secondary and subordinate position*. Therefore, in studying any complex process in which there are two or more contradictions, we must devote every effort to finding its principal contradiction. Once this principal contradiction is grasped, all problems can be readily solved.

SICA
    Social Investigation and Class Analysis; data-driven methodology for
    understanding class composition at granular geographic levels.

Settler Colonialism
	A particular form of the general process of colonialism whereby a class of individuals called **settlers** systematically eradicate Indigenous nations with the intention of depopulating the land to be colonized and repopulated by the settlers. The expropriated land is brought into capitalist property relationships for repopulation, ownership, exploitation, and extraction of resources as the outcome of the expropriation and genocide. This contradiction represents an ongoing process which is never completed just as the contradiction between bourgeoisie and proletariat is never completed. This is because the contradiction is one between the settler class and the Indigenous population **over ownership and use of the land**.

super-profits
    Excess profits derived from imperialism and unequal exchange.

weighted edges
    Graph connections with numeric weights representing strength/frequency.

desire paths
    Trails created by actual usage rather than planned design; emergent structure.
