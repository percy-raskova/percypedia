# Schrödinger's Bathroom

In the olden days
Of misery and confusion 
Before I could be me
The decision on where to piss
Could barely be said 
to be a decision at all.

It was more like a reflex.
My bladder fills up
And my body commands my brain 
To excrete a foul yellow liquid from my cock. To expel 

Toxins
Poisons
Impurities 
Excrements of body and soul.

In other words, to piss.

But as the process involves whipping ones dick out
And excreting a fluid from it
One simply cannot do it wherever!
For reasons both sanitary and ethical.

And so therefore
One gallivants to the lavatory 
To drain the foul serpent.
To empty ones bladder.
And go on with their day.

Finding such a room 
Where it's socially appropriate
To pee uninterrupted 
Was never much of a thought 
When I lived my life as a man.

But when I decided to live as a woman
And to be who Ive always been
Deep down inside
The calculus of where to piss
Took on a life of its own.

The bathroom ceased to be a mere reflex.
My "choice"
If one could even say it involved an act of the will
Took an odd development.

No longer was the decision to pee
Merely a reflex of my mind reacting to my body.
It took on whole new dimension.

When I need to piss 
I'm no longer just a woman
But rather a commander
On an ideological battlefield
In the war against fascism.

My conscious decision 
Of where to excrete urine
Has evolved from a choice of convenience
Into a tactical assessment of battlefield safety.

If I pee in the womens latrine
Will Fraulein Hitler be there?
Waiting for me, like a jaguar 
Ready to pounce on her prey?

Will a histrionic female SS officer
Shriek in delight, calling me a rapist
And loudly harass me as a ladyboy
Who seeks to harass her in the sacred space
Of the female latrine?
Of that divine porcelain temple
To the feminine goddesses?

However...

If I piss in the men's room
Will Herr Obersgrüpenfurher Himmler be there?
Waiting for me, like a jaguar
Ready to pounce on his prey?

Will a histrionic male SS officer
Shriek in delight, calling me a faggot
And murder me for being a ladyboy
Who totally wants to suck him off
In his totally-not-gay-bro 
Definitely-not-a-fantasy 
Sexual intrusive thoughts he's ashamed to have?

My bodily urges have forced me
To adopt the world view
Of that famous physicist Schrodinger
Renowned for his pussycat

Oh how I empathize with that cat
Who's fate we cannot know
Who's status of alive or dead
Remains indeterminate
Never to be seen 
Until I open the doors 
Of a bathroom adorned by a gendered sigil
And plunge forward
Into quantum uncertainty
