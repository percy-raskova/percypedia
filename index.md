No investigation, no right to speak.

-- Mao Zedong, *Oppose Book Worship* (1930)

Welcome to **Percypedia**, the personal encyclopedia and digital brain of Persephone Raskova: Marxist-Leninist-Maoist, transgender combat veteran, cloud data engineer, and person who has *very strong opinions* about Sphinx documentation engines.

```{admonition} What is this place?
:class: tip

This is a living knowledge base built with MyST Markdown and Sphinx. It contains:

- **Theory** — Polemics on settler colonialism, the labor aristocracy, and why your favorite leftist org is probably revisionist
- **Investigations** — Forensic accounting deep-dives into organizational corruption (with receipts)
- **Creative Writing** — Satirical meditations on topics Marx definitely forgot to address
- **Self-Criticism** — Because if you're not constantly interrogating your own errors, are you even doing dialectics?
```

## The Principal Contradiction of This Website

Is it a personal wiki? A political manifesto? An elaborate excuse to learn Sphinx extensions? **Yes.**

The content here ranges from serious theoretical analysis to unhinged shitposts about gambling under socialism. If you came here expecting ideological consistency presented in a dry academic tone, I have bad news for you. If you came here expecting someone to tell you the Maoist Third Worldist position on slot machines, you're in exactly the right place.

## A Note on Editorial Bias

This encyclopedia is not neutral. It is written from the perspective of someone who believes:

1. The United States is a settler-colonial project built on stolen land
2. The "working class" in the imperial core is largely a labor aristocracy
3. Revolution requires actual investigation, not just reading theory
4. Criticism and self-criticism are essential tools, not personal attacks
5. Revolutionaries need a sense of humor or we'll all go insane

If these positions offend you, there are approximately 47 million other websites you could be reading instead.
