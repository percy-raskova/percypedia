## Revolutionary Opportunity in Kansas

```{important}
There are two major revolutionary activities in Kansas that nobody is trying. To my knowledge they've never been tried. The closest attempt was the ICL campaign in Lawrence.
```

1. **Organizing migrant workers in Kansas.** These are the non labor aristocratic proletariat. They by far have the most revolutionary potential and furthermore if they were organized, a disruption to the food supply chain from an ag state like Kansas would have a major destabilizing effect on not only Kansas economy but the entire United States.

2. **Agitate against the Military.** Kansas is a huge military state. Most people don't realize it. Especially with Palestine going on, we should across the state be organizing in our own local areas to disrupt the functions of the military by whatever means. For example in Manhattan, MHK has a huge and close tie to Fort Riley. Why aren't we agitating around that? Fort Riley has deployed soldiers to Israel in the past. We have a firm connection there. Why has there never been a campaign to try to drive a wedge between the civilian population and the army?

Same with Wichita. Just last month Wichita deployed some 10 or so air refuelling planes to Kuwait to support the Israeli air force and its bombing of Iran and Palestine. Where is the resistance to McConnell AFB in Wichita? I've never even heard of such a campaign tho if one exists Id love to know more.

Like if we are truly serious about a revolution. Revolution isn't coming from labor unions or tenant organizing or campaigning to get people into city council. Revolution in Kansas looks like salting the giant agrifarms and embedding among the migrant laborers, learning Spanish, and organizing with them to an explicitly revolutionary means. It also looks like disrupting the good relationships that every military base in Kansas has with its community. Soldiers and Airmen should be walking pariahs. Their uniforms should be associated with DUIs, rapes, and other crimes that harm the community. People should be educated on these things. In my view that's the move but every time I bring this up I feel like it always gets dismissed and it's frustrating.

The worst nightmare of every military base is to be hated by the community and to provoke mass protests that are disruptive and to make the environment hostile for soldiers. It worked during Vietnam. Who knows maybe if we had been trying this since last October we could have mounted enough mass pressure to disrupt a deployment of aircraft refilling planes to aid in genocide. But the genocide planes flew uninterrupted. No one was even aware this was happening. As far as I know I'm the first person to have even pointed this out! How can we say we support Palestine and then be completely oblivious to our states complicity in sending Israel logistical support? The matter or fact is to be blunt: We failed Palestine. Miserably. Just feels like folks are more happy to aimlessly March in a circle and take selfies for Instagram than do anything that might be the slightest bit risky but could actually be effective. It's more important to Be Seen Doing Stuff than actually have an impact. And to be frank it pisses me the fuck off.

## Introduction

I am taking time to intentionally reflect upon the time I've spent organizing in the state of Kansas. As of right now it's November 2024. I've been here actively organizing (or trying to) since 2020. While looking back on things I've seen that I have developed a lot, but I'm still always improving. I want to take this opportunity to document those shortcomings.

I will be leaving Kansas in the summer of 2025 not withstanding an extenuating circumstance. To prepare for that I'm plan on stepping back from all things Kansas organizing related in early 2025, maybe March or April. So I am at the end of my organizing time. I won't be giving up on the enterprise entirely, but rather setting up shop once I've had time to acquaint in a new location. There's numerous reasons for that, not all of which are organizing related. I won't get into them here. But I want to cover this while it's fresh on my mind.

One last point is that while I am a fan of the after action review format of criticism and self criticism, this is going to be kind of stream of thought, on the fly. A narrative format so to speak. That's just how I write. But crit and self-crit will none the less be the major theme. Additionally I will take time to depart from CSC to give a summary of what I see as the political economy of Kansas, as well as give my own assessments of the 'state of the Left'. So it's going to be broader in scope than a typical AAR.

```{note}
If just one person in Kansas reading this can walk away from it with some clarity in their mind about the task ahead, my time won't have been wasted. It'll be up to others to continue the struggle here.

## My Specific Organizing Experience in Kansas

(early-stage)=
### Early Stage

Oddly enough, of all the places one can start organizing, I started around 2020 at the time of George Floyd. At this time I was in the process of getting out of the military, and was completely disillusioned from it. Seeing the insurrection unfold across the US while wearing that uniform only confirmed and solidified my beliefs that the Army was the Great Satan. While I got a shit ton of things wrong in this period, on that point I was admittedly correct.

Naturally wearing the uniform, at the time my primary aspect of my identity that was strongest was that of being a soldier. Even if I hated myself for it and hated what the uniform represented, it still didn't change the fact I chose consciously to wear it. So, motivated by the nationwide political developments of the Floyd Insurrection and the COVID pandemic, I reached out to a veterans organization called About Face. I didn't really do much with that org other than help write some stuff for a protest manual. No idea if anyone ever actually used it, but I did contribute some basic knowledge. I also ended up leaving this group because it felt like it was going down a very liberal path. But in terms of my development, it lead me to meet my first actual comrade at the time who I will refer to as Jane.

Jane and I met thru that org, and instantly felt the kind of solidarity one can only feel with another soldier. We met, discussed, and although we had some ideological differences (in retrospect J seemed to have a vague and eclectic mixture of Maoism and radical feminism a la Dworkin, whereas I had a very confused and elementary interpretation of Marxism-Leninism with a focus on anti-imperialism), we had enough in common to try to start something.

We organized our first protest which was the burning of an American flag in a high traffic park. In retrospect, while this felt cool at the time, it was more for a mixture of shock value and catharsis as a ritual by which we both publicly renounced our allegiance and status as veterans. Nobody except a random guy waking by and what felt like half of the RCPD showed up (thankfully the cops showed up after we left! I was told they were angry and wanted to write us a ticket for an illegal fire or something like that by the random passerby). Nobody was moved by this gesture or suddenly became a communist. But nobody was harmed, and we both emotionally felt better about our selves, so while maybe it wasn't an actual protest at least it had therapeutic value.

The other organizing act we did, which arguably did have a better impact, was donating COVID-19 supplies to a domestic violence shelters for women on the Kaw Nation reservation in Oklahoma. If I recall we did raise somewhere around $1,000 which was gathered between begging online for GoFundMe donations and me auctioning off some magic cards of value that I owned. But a disagreement between Jane and I came up that would become a recurring theme in my organizing. She complained I was "taking up too much space" and said because of that she didn't want to organize with me. While I won't deny that I sometimes do have an opportunity to burst into places and try to take charge of things, the fact of the matter is **if I didn't do that, we wouldn't have raised any money.**

```{important}
This is a broader issue among organizing communities in that everyone thinks it's a participating activity where it's an intrinsic good to have as many hands on something as possible. **But the point of organizing isn't to give everyone a say. The point of organizing is to accomplish a democratically agreed upon task.** While it's always good to get as many people involved as possible, we should never be involving people just for the sake of letting everyone be involved. Mao called this error 'ultrademocracy.' It leads to impotence, stagnation and atrophy. Ultrademocracy is the death knell of organizations. It arises from a petit bourgeois liberal attitude that everyone has to be personally involved in every single decision and action, that they're entitled to it.
```

After getting out of the army in 2021, high on what I thought was the correct interpretation of Marxism, I hit the ground running. I was ambitious! I wanted to form the Communist Party of Kansas (Marxist-Leninist); I wanted to set up Food Not Bombs; I wanted to run a book club. I wanted to do it all. And because I wanted it all I accomplished pretty much nothing.

A side note here for context. Without going into too much detail (if you know then you know), I suffer from some pretty debilitating mental illnesses. I mean after all I am a transgender combat veteran. I'm a ticking time bomb basically!

Although I am ultimately the person responsible for my actions and behaviors, Id also be remiss in acknowledging that living as a closeted and self-unaware trans woman transitioning out of seven years of military service with absolutely zero support structures and a smorgasbord of mental illnesses contributed in many ways to my follies.

## Revolutionary Opportunity in Kansas

Some Comrades with whom I disagree (particularly Comrade A who I've discussed this at immense length with) have raised a concern that my Maoist Third Worldist ideology lends itself to a kind of defeatism. If everyone is a corrupt labor aristocrat, then doesn't that imply it's impossible to organize? Can't we simply educate the workers out of their confused allegiances? These are two questions raised from numerous discussions on the matter with many well meaning Comrades.

To thoroughly answer it would be outside the scope of this essay, as this is an analysis of Kansas and not an exposition of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism Third Worldism. What I will instead propose here, is a kind of direct refutation of the revolutionary pessimism criticism. I will address this criticism by offering up what I believe are two fruitful arenas of struggle which I believe any organizers in Kansas would be wise to consider.

I'll acknowledge that some immature Marxists have, upon realizing the correct truth of Maoism Third Worldism (MTW) just thrown their hands up and said "I give up! It's impossible!" So I can understand where the temptation to write off MTW comes from. But I am not one of them. Never ever have I made the argument that we should somehow give up on our revolutionary organizing simply because a scientific analysis revealed the situations more complicated than we initially realized.

In fact, this is a kind of exciting realization! We literally get to write a new chapter of revolutionary history. We get to take a shot at solving a revolutionary problem that nobody to this day has ever came close to solving. That might intimidate some, but personally I welcome the challenge. If comrades disagree with MTW, that's fine. But please engage with my words and my actions as they actually exist, instead of shadowboxing an imaginary representation of me in your mind.

### Organizing Undocumented Laborers

Kansas, as an agricultural state, has a population of [1406 migrant farm workers as of 2023](https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article286835885.html#:~:text=The%20two%20states%20are%20among,workers%2C%20employed%20by%20116%20businesses.). These 1406 workers are employed among 220 businesses which means roughly 7 workers per business. Of course, the numbers probably reflect some degree of concentration. IE a few firms employ the vast majority. Only a proper investigation can tell. But that would be the first place to begin pursuing this - a detailed political economic analysis of agriculture labor in Kansas generally, and of migrant labor specifically.

Why migrant farm labor? Migrant farm laborers are the non labor aristocratic proletariat in America. Furthermore, they are subjected to the additional oppression of America's cruel immigration bureaucracy.

In addition to documented migrant workers, Kansas also is home to a population of [64,000 undocumented immigrants](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/data/unauthorized-immigrant-population/state/KS). 81% of them are from Central America and Mexico, and 79% speak Spanish. 45% of them do not speak English at all. Roughly 30% have no more than a middle school education, and 51% have only a high school degree. 25% live below the poverty line and 61% do not have health insurance of any kind. Most work in the Construction industry as well as food services. More investigation would be needed to map out precise employers, but this is a start.

## Advice for Future Revolutionaries

Here is a list of things I would suggest to any up-and-coming revolutionaries in Kansas. It's a combination of general truths but seasoned by the particularity of my experiences and errors.

1. **Ideological unity is what you should be aiming to achieve.**
2. **Do not pursue popularity at the cost of principles.**
3. **So called left unity is beyond worthless.**
4. **It's fine to build coalitions around specific goals. But you need to lead those coalitions on your terms.**
5. **It's important to build community, but also remember that this shit isn't a game or a hobby.**
6. **The mission always comes first.**
7. **Don't even bother engaging in electoralism.**
8. **Ultrademocracy is the org killer**
9. **Your organization must be able to reproduce it's capacity for labor power. It must also be able to correct course through criticism and self criticism.**
10. **If you only bother to interact with the Activist Subculture, your org will die. To thrive you need to expand outside of the Activist Subculture.**
11. **The masses are your security. Earning the trust of the people is the ultimate defense against state repression.**
