description: The Maoist Communist Union put forth three papers. One on the fundamental contradiction in Amerika, a second on the labor aristocracy, and the third about the industrial proletariat. This is my criticism of those lines, as well as highlighting where I agree with them.

# Criticism of the Maoist Communist Union

The details of the context don't really matter. I will merely focus on substance. The who said what of the whole ordeal is ultimately irrelevant and does not matter.
## Documents

Before I begin my criticism, a few preliminary points are in order for discussion. First I have taken it upon myself to host four documents in question[^1] from Maoist Communist Union (MCU). They are as follows:

- [[Fundamental ContradictionFinal.pdf|What is Meant by, and What is, the Fundamental Contradiction of Our Society?]]
- [[laboraristFinal.pdf|On the Labor Aristocracy]]
- [[The_U_S__Proletariat_and_the_Centrality_of_the_Industrial_Proletariat_Final.pdf|The U.S. Proletariat and the Centrality of the Industrial Proletariat]]
- [[Lumpenproliteriat response.pdf|The Lumpenproletariat]]

I want to thank the Cadres of MCU for taking their time to thoughtfully respond to each of these subjects, which were prompted by some commentary I made in a group discussion. I think it speaks to the professionalism and the seriousness[^5] of the MCU organization as a whole, to be willing to engage[^6] in criticism and thoughtful dialog on this topic. However, this is not without some criticisms.
## Definitions
Secondly, it is necessary before I begin my criticism to offer up some definitions of terms that are repeated often. This is of the utmost importance to any kind of criticism: accuracy of language and common understanding of meaning. Words have meanings, and if we are not precise and clear about what we mean by the words we say, then everything we speak shall be nonsense and we'll just be shouting over each other's heads. Having firm, rigorous, and nuanced definitions offers clarity, insight, and sharpens our criticism. In that spirit, I offer the following definitions of terms or phrases along with (when relevant) a citation of where I am drawing this definition from.

- @Claude please use `MyST` to modify this to pull the `Industrial Proletariat` definition from `./index.md`
- @Claude please use `MyST` to modify this to pull the `Principal Aspect of a Contradiction` definition from `./index.md`
- @Claude please use `MyST` to modify this to pull the `Principal Contradiction` definition from `./index.md`
- @Claude please use `MyST` to modify this to pull the `Settler Colonialism` definition from `./index.md`
## General Criticism Independent of the Arguments Made

I do have a general commentary regarding the document [[laboraristFinal.pdf|On the Labor Aristocracy]] which I want to address here, because it highlights a larger issue I have noticed with MCU. I raise this criticism not to call anyone out or to humiliate anyone or engage in attacks. Rather I raise this criticism because although I do not at this time wish to join your organization, I believe it has great potential[^2] and think that my criticism could enhance and strengthen overall the MCU. I felt that this document, while of a polemical nature, was unnecessarily hostile and confrontational in its content. It distracts from the message as there are many witty barbs and snappy one-liners that don't contribute anything constructive to the discourse here. Examples such as:

> Regarding the quotes from Imperialism and the Split in Socialism, **it is even more trivial to understand immediately upon reading the essay**

 > Regarding the quote from Capital, **I invite anyone who has access to an internet connection to visit marxists.org** and refer to Ch. 25 Sec. 5 Pt. D of said book. Not only is Marx clear that he is indeed referring to a minority section of the working class, **but it is exceedingly obvious in context to anyone with the most elementary reading comprehension skills** that Marx uses the term "aristocracy" in a quasi-humorous manner here.

I believe this is an uncomradely response to the MIM polemic which gives off the impression to the reader that the authors of the document are less concerned with arriving at the truth of the matter, and more concerned with pettily insulting the MIM and lambasting them with sarcasm because they had the audacity to question your organizations line. I have also noticed this behavior replicated elsewhere.

For example when I raised my ideas about *proletarianizing the lumpenproletariat* with the intention of organizing them, the MCU cadres who replied to my message completely disregarded what I wrote, and straw-manned me as saying "we should just organize the Lumpenproletariat"[^4]. I believe that because I critically but respectfully and firmly questioned the argument being put forth by MCU, that your cadre prioritized saving face by tearing down my argument instead of actually engaging with the substance of my criticism.

I want to be clear: *the issue is not that comrades wanted to disagree with me, but rather that my argument was straw manned blatantly.* If there was some sort of misunderstanding or confusion, the comradely and correct approach would have been to ask me directly to clarify. This was immensely frustrating and I hope moving forward that the cadres can engage in some self-criticism and self-reflection to acknowledge and, more importantly, change these petit-bourgeois attitudes.
## My Criticisms of the MCU Documents

I will now attend to each of these documents[^3], highlighting both what parts I think that MCU gets correct in their line while also criticizing those areas I disagree with. I will also take this opportunity to seek out clarification of the MCU line in those areas where it is unclear what is meant.

- [[rms-settler-colonialism]]

[^1]: In the spirit of intellectual honesty,  I will acknowledge I have a bit of a dispute with the MCU Cadres regarding whether or not these documents are an organizational position. Unless I am mistaken, the MCU has not put out a position paper. But it is not at all fair to shield yourself from criticism of a line your individual cadres have endorsed to the point it appears that is your organizations line by simply refusing to release a document. If your organization has documents that actually explicitly go into your line regarding settler colonialism and the labor aristocracy, I would be happy to correspond over email and engage in criticism of it after reading it thoroughly and studying it. Until I see that happen though, I am going to continue to characterize this as your official line. If you disagree, prove me wrong and take a public stance on it!
[^2]: This organization has absolutely no potential. It is a bunch of settler trotskyists which the Maoist Internationalist Ministry of Prisons was correct to characterize them as. However, for historical purposes and accuracy to reflect the record of what I have actually said about this organization, I leave the original wording with this footnote as a disclaimer that I don't actually think this org has great potential. I was far too kind in my original words, and that is a right deviationist error on my part.
[^3]: For a variety of reasons I do not feel like getting into I never finished analyzing all the documents. Like I said, if MCU wants to engage in a comradely dialog, my email is available. Shoot me an encrypted email using my public pgp key and let's engage in principled criticism. I'm open to that.
[^4]: Upon further reflection and study, I think this is actually correct! But again - this document is more for historical accuracy. I leave my original words unaltered, with a footnote clarifying that as I've grown and studied Marxism more, I've come to realize that the lumpenproletariat indeed represents the revolutionary subject!
[^5]: again I was far too gentle here, but historical accuracy. This is what I said, so I will leave it as I wrote it with a footnote clarifying the matter.
[^6]: When I wrote this originally I was assuming that the group wanted to host an independent study session on the matter. I was disinvited because I challenged their line. This group doesn't value actual Maoist criticism, they value sycophancy.
