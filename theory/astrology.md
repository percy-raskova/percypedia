# Astrology as a Vector for Fascism

Savitri Devi was a Nazi spiritual guru who tailored mysticism, esotericism, and divine spiritual insights into justifying fascist beliefs in racial supremacy. By examining her legacy, we can extrapolate that to an understanding of the fascistic nature of astrology.

## Preface

At first, one might be perplexed or even offended at the notion of astrology -- the idea that {doc}`essentialism` personality traits and insights into the personality complexes of people can be divined from star charts and the alignment of celestial bodies at the time of one's birth -- as a vector for fascism. Before getting into the argument of why I believe this to be the case, I want to clarify a few things because the reader may have some reasonable concerns which I wish to assuage.

(astrology-proxy-womanhood)=
## Astrology as Proxy for Womanhood

Firstly, while astrology has no implicit gender and there are people of all genders who enjoy astrology as a hobby, it's definitely something that's very much female-coded. What do I mean by this? By female-coded I simply mean that according to the prevailing gender ideology, the hobby of astrology has a strong correlation to things enjoyed by women in much the same way that gardening, boy bands, makeup and salons are associated with femininity. It's not that men can't get into astrology; in fact, there are countless men who read horoscopes to determine if their secret crush would be open to going on a date with them. Just as there are men who go to the salon for a manicure, men who enjoy gardening, etc. But we would be fooling ourselves if we didn't acknowledge the fact that astrology, like the other mentioned hobbies, is associated with womanhood far more than it is with masculinity.

Why bring up this distinction? Simply put, because a lot of individuals and especially women who take an interest in astrology, rightly point out that chauvinistic men will use the hobby of astrology as a kind of substitution for femininity in an attempt to openly engage in misogynistic behavior in a disguised fashion. Although these men will attack astrology on its grounds of unfalsifiability, unscientific methodologies, and spiritual jargon, it's clear that the subtext of this "criticism" is that they are saying that by extension of astrology being woman-coded that therefore women are unscientific, irrational, illogical, and what not.

:::{important}
This, of course, is nothing more than thinly veiled patriarchal behavior that uses the guise of scientific concern to paper over rancid misogyny. I want to assure the reader that I am sensitive to these concerns, and that I wholeheartedly refute this. In fact, as I will demonstrate, **my criticism is actually in line with feminist values because the subject of attack is not womanhood or femininity, but rather gender essentialism** -- an ideology which feminist thought correctly seeks to combat and destroy.
:::

The misogynists who criticise astrology do so in a way that reifies and solidifies gender essentialism. Therein lies the difference between my criticism and the criticism of the misogynists.

(attacking-idea-not-individual)=
## Attacking the Idea, Not the Individual

I also want to clarify that **I am not saying that every individual who enjoys astrology is a Hitlerite Nazi**. That would be a completely ludicrous and absurd claim! Although I have no doubts there are some Nazi astrology fans, the vast majority of people who take a passing interest in astrology do so as a casual hobby in the same way that one might go on Facebook and take a "Which Batman character are you?" quiz to pass the time.

:::{note}
The subject of my criticism is not the individuals who enjoy reading horoscopes in the Sunday newspaper. Rather, my criticism is in the underlying philosophical assumptions and assertions of astrology as a body of knowledge.
:::

This is additionally another factor which separates my critique from that of the misogynists. The misogynists attack astrology to tear down individual women; my criticism attacks astrology in order to attack fascism. If anything, it can be considered as a defense of womanhood because fascism is necessarily misogynistic.

(utility-of-astrology)=
## The Utility of Astrology

To be blunt, astrology is completely false. It has no basis whatsoever in science. It makes about as much sense as augury or sorcery as a basis of knowledge. Again, as we are not here to have a discussion of the science of astronomy, we will simply assert that there is absolutely no correlation between the alignment of the solar system and one's personality. Any assertions to this effect are either tautological[^1] or have absolutely zero evidence in scientific fact. We shall not dwell on the science, though we shall return to the subject of tautology which is very relevant to how fascism utilizes astrology.

Despite the lack of scientific rigor over astrological claims over personality taxonomies, people nonetheless place great stock into these. For example, many people will make decisions about romantic partners based on star signs. Other people decide to invest their savings dependent upon an astrologer's interpretation of the stars. The list goes on. Therefore, despite the illogical and irrational foundation of these beliefs, they warrant paying attention to simply for how they affect people's social relationships and decisions.

## Astrology's Philosophical Underpinnings

Now that we have pre-empted some criticisms and assuaged the reasonable concerns of the reader, who might assume a defensive posture in light of the provocative title of the article, let us continue to the meat and potatoes. Before we get into the link between fascism and astrology, we first have to discuss what the theoretical foundations and underlying assumptions of astrology are.

At its core, astrology represents the idea that one's "star sign", or alignment of celestial bodies at the time of birth, can offer insights into individual psychology, personality, and behavior. There is an entire intricate system that governs the interrelationships between these stars, with elaborate schemes about the angles of inclination of the sun and its relationship to whether or not the moon was full or a crescent; the retrograde status of mercury; and so on. The particulars here are not important, so no more attention shall be paid to these details. They do not matter for the discussion at hand.

What does matter, is that...

[^1]: A tautology is a statement which is true by definition. For example, the statement "Either you are hungry, or you are not hungry" is a tautology because there is no possible logical configuration of its constituent components -- the claim "you are hungry" and its negation -- in which the overall statement is false. The statement evaluates to TRUE in every possible logical permutation of combining those statements. If we let `p=hungry` then by definition our tautological statement can be represented as `NOT-p OR p`. If `p=TRUE`, then `NOT-p OR p` is `TRUE` because the `OR` operator evaluates to TRUE. I leave as an exercise to the reader, to work out why `NOT-p OR p` evaluates to `TRUE` when `p=FALSE`.
