# Essentialism

:::{warning}

Essentialism is the philosophical position that things (including people, social groups, and categories) have inherent, immutable essences that define what they fundamentally are. This idealist conception stands in opposition to materialist dialectics, which understands things as processes shaped by historical and material conditions.

## Critique from a Materialist Perspective

Marxist materialism rejects essentialism because:

- It treats social categories as fixed rather than historically constructed
- It naturalizes oppression by claiming certain groups are "inherently" inferior or superior
- It ignores the material conditions that produce observed differences
- It serves to justify existing power relations as "natural"
