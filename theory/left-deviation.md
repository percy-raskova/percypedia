# Left Deviation

:::{warning}
**This document is a stub.** Content has not yet been written.
:::

The left deviation, or ultra-leftism, represents an error in revolutionary practice characterized by:

- Demanding too much too fast from the masses
- Treating the masses as inherently defective rather than uneducated
- Refusing to meet people where they are
- Sectarianism and dogmatism
- Preferring purity over progress
